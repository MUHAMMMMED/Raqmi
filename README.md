This project digitizes and unifies educational books from multiple sources to create a structured, AI-accessible knowledge
base. It enables teachers and AI-driven learning systems to access, analyze, and generate contextual explanations without
relying on external references.
The system includes:
 Structured content management for lessons, sections, and references.
 AI-powered study assistant for generating explanations and insights.
 • Built-in creative tools for content generation (e.g., Canva-style editors, video generation).
 • Knowledge background engine to provide a consistent reference layer for educational AI models.
This module operates as a separate component within a larger learning platform, designed to be integrated or used
independently.
